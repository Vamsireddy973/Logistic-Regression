# Logistic-Regression
This project demonstrates how weight initialization, loss function selection, and learning rate tuning impact the performance of a Logistic Regression model built using PyTorch.  The main objective is to analyze how improper model configuration affects convergence and classification accuracy in a binary classification task.
